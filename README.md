Feel free to check out my other mini projects for extra practice and don't forget to star the repo! 

## Test Scenarios:
- The calculator will display (an unofficial) answer on the left side of the screen before the equals button or enter key is pressed; think of it like a running total. 
- The calculator will show the equation history on the top right side of the calculator screen.
- The calculator will display the final answer in full opacity. 
- When user hovers over a number or symbol, the background color will change.
- All mathematical operations and functionality work as expected.
- The user is able to click on screen or use their keyboard/keypad.
